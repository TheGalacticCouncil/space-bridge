Test setup:
Encoder is turned back and forth several times to generate events.
Code and configs can be found through git.


 = Original code (old observations) =

InputPoller	0.455 -  0.642	ms 
EventMaker	8     -	10 	    ms
udpSender	  3     -  4	    ms


 = Original code (Profile 0) =

InputPoller	 0.398 -  0.442 ms 
EventMaker	15     - 56 	  ms
udpSender	   2     -  4	    ms

notes:
Couple anomalous InputPoller times were discarded. ~1.500 ms each
At the same time also EventMaker and UdpSender times spiked, 
99-313 ms and 7 ms respectively.

 = Precalculated for-ranges in InpP (Case 1) =

InputPoller	 0.348 -  0.351
EventMaker	12.    - 51.
udpSender	 2.    -  4.

notes:
A single longer 0.494 InputPoller cycle was observed. It was far enough 
above the rest that it was considered an anomaly and discarded.

IP performance improvement was calculated at about 10 - 20%.
10% for minimum time and 20% for maximum. 10% is within variation, 
but 20 seems significant.

 = Localized instances (Case 2) =

Case 2 was recorded, but was incomplete in some way, so 
no in debth review was done.


= Note =
Further values are in microseconds.


 = Profile 3.1 Analysis = 

udpSender() -300 µs -34 %
EventMaker:
  - event() -166 µs -15 %
  - payloader()  -19 µs -11 %
InputPoller()
  - polling -88 µs  -5 %
AnalogReader -114 µs  -3 %
EncoderReader -30 µs -3 %* Unreliable measurements. Anomaly propagation
ButtonInput   0 µs  0 % can be optimized for -85 µs >60%


 = Observatrions =

 - Analog rescale() could be integrated (-200 �s)                   # done
 - Encoder read() variable += variable is slower than variable += 1  # done
   see if (if/elif/else) could be simplifyed to (if/else except?)    # is...?
 - check Encoder rescale() elif logic. Unusual exec tiems!            # done
 - Button read() remove GPIO re-initialization (-85 �s >60%)        # kindoff
 - event config: test list comp at different lengths...              # 


 = Profile 4 Analysis = 

udpSender() -300 µs -34 %
EventMaker:
  - event() -155 µs -14 %
  - payloader()  -20 µs -11 %
InputPoller()
  - polling  -113 µs  -18 %
  - w.inputs -248 µs  -8 %
AnalogReader -376 µs  -12 %
EncoderReader +20 µs +2 %* Unreliable measurements. Anomaly propagation
ButtonInput   -31 µS -17 %


 = Observatrions =

 - Encoder read() variable += variable is not necessarelly slower 
   than variable += 1. Reverting to previous
 - Revert Encoder rescale(), unexpected performance degredation,
   Reverting to (almost) original.
   In total a -100 µs improvement could be realized
